      "page_content='William Bradley Pitt (born December 18, 1963) is an American actor and film producer. He is the recipient of various accolades, including two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. One of the most influential celebrities, Pitt appeared on Forbes' annual Celebrity 100 list  from 2006 to 2008, and the Time 100 list in 2007.\nPitt first gained recognition as a cowboy hitchhiker in the Ridley Scott road film Thelma & Louise (1991). Pitt emerged as a star taking on leading man roles in films such as the drama A River Runs Through It (1992), the western Legends of the Fall (1994), the horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994), and the crime thriller Seven (1995). Pitt found greater commercial success starring in Steven Soderbergh's heist film Ocean's Eleven (2001), and reprised his role in its sequels. He cemented his leading man status starring in blockbusters such as the historical epic Troy (2004), the romantic crime film Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), the horror film World War Z (2013), and the action film Bullet Train (2022).\nPitt won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing a stuntman in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019). He was Oscar-nominated for his roles in the science fiction drama 12 Monkeys (1995), the fantasy romance The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and the sports drama Moneyball (2011). He also starred in acclaimed films such as Fight Club (1999), Babel (2006), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), Burn After Reading (2008), Inglourious Basterds (2009), The Tree of Life (2011), and The Big Short (2015). \nIn 2001, Pitt co-founded the production company Plan B Entertainment. As a producer he won the Academy Award for Best Picture for 12 Years a Slave (2013) and was nominated for Moneyball (2011) and The Big Short (2015). Pitt was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1995 and 2000.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWilliam Bradley Pitt was born on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, the proprietor of a trucking company, and Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counselor. The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas Pitt (b. 1966) and Julie (née Pitt) Neal (b. 1969). Born into a conservative Christian household, he was raised as Southern Baptist and later \"oscillate[d] between agnosticism and atheism.\" He later reconciled his belief in spirituality. Pitt has described Springfield as \"Mark Twain country, Jesse James country,\" having grown up with \"a lot of hills, a lot of lakes.\"\nPitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming, and tennis teams. He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals. Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising. As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—\"a portal into different worlds for me\"—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made. Two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs. He has named Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, and Mickey Rourke as his early acting heroes.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early work (1987–1993) ===\nWhile struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London. His acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out (1987), No Man's Land (1987) and Less than Zero (1987).

I’ll discuss the differences between the ABAC and legacy Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) approaches to control access and how the RBAC approach is not sufficient to keep up with today’s growing big data market. With so much data available, there also comes substantial risk. Data can contain many sensitive data elements, including PII and PHI. Industry leaders like Databricks are pushing the boundaries of data technology, which leads to constantly evolving data use cases. And that’s a good thing! However, the RBAC approach is struggling to keep up with those advancements.\n",
       " So what is RBAC? It’s an approach to data access that permits system access based on the end-user’s role. For legacy systems, it’s meant as a simple but effective approach to securing data. Are you a manager? Then you’ll get access to data meant for managers. This is great for small deployments with clearly defined roles. Here at Booz Allen, we invested in Databricks because we have an environment of over 30k users and billions of rows of data.\n",
       " To mitigate this problem and align with our forward-thinking company standard, we introduced Immuta into our stack. Immuta uses ABAC to allow for dynamic data access control. Users are automatically assigned certain attributes, and access is based on those attributes instead of just their role. This allows for more flexibility and allows data access control to easily scale without the need to constantly map a user to their role. Using attributes, we can write policies in one place and have them applied across all of our data platforms. This makes for a truly holistic data governance approach and provides immediate ROI and time savings for the company.</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Increasing Trust in Your Data: Enabling a Data Governance Program on Databricks Using Unity Catalog and ML-Driven MDM</td><td>As part of Comcast Effectv’s transformation into a completely digital advertising agency, it was key to develop an approach to manage and remediate data quality issues related to customer data so that the sales organization is using reliable data to enable data-driven decision making.

       " We will also share the benefits we’ve found in using Unity Catalog, beyond just access management, such as: \n",
       " * Visibility into which data assets we have in the organization\n",
       " * Ability to identify and potentially eliminate duplicate data workloads between departments \n",

Powered by cutting edge science, we leverage first-party retail data from nearly one out of two US households totaling over 2B transactions a year. Databricks is integral to the data science and machine learning work at 84.51° and manages 35+ PB of first-party customer data across 150+ Databricks workspaces. Before Unity Catalog, this data was structured in a decentralized data mesh which had issues including problematic data sharing, minimal data governance, and no auditing of data extracts. In this session, we will discuss how 84.51° incrementally rolled out Unity Catalog company-wide in a way that involved minimal disruption of existing processes and how UC-enabled solutions solved several real-world problems including:\n",
       " • Being able to migrate an on-prem solution to a Databricks SQL Warehouse with HIPAA auditing and data governance which resulted in reduced on-prem costs and enabled new solutions/products to bring significant new revenue sources. \n",
       " • Leveraging Delta Sharing to eliminate duplication of data and processing and enabling new insights to provide a deeper, more personal approach to customer engagement.\n",
       "Databricks has also been key to the 84.51° Collaborative Cloud, which provides our clients' data scientists a platform that provides clean and ready-to-use transaction and UPC-level data from 60 million households empowering companies to get value out of data science, regardless of where they sit on the readiness spectrum. Unity Catalog will be key to extend the collaborative cloud functionality and cleanroom technology with improved security and governance.</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Lakehouse as a FAIR Platform</td><td>FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data and data platforms are becoming more and more important in public sector. Lakehouse platform is strongly aligned with these principles. Lakehouse provides tools required to both adhere to FAIR but also to FAIRify data that isn't FAIR compliant. In this session we will cover parts of the lakehouse that enable end users to FAIRify data products, how to build good robust data products and which parts of Lakehouse align to which principles in FAIR. We'll demonstrate how DLT is crucial for data transformations on nonFAIR data, how Unity Catalog unlocks discoverability (F) and governed data access (A), and how marketplace, cleanrooms and Delta Sharing unlock interoperability and data exchange (I and R). All of these concepts are massive enablers for highly regulated industries such as Public Sector. It undeniably important to align Lakehouse to standards that are widely adopted by standards and policy makers and regulators. These principles transcend all industries and all use cases.</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Engineers Shouldn't Write Data Governance Policies</td><td>Controlling permissions for accessing data assets can be messy, time consuming, and usually a combination of both. The teams responsible for creating the business rules that govern who should have access to what data are usually different from the teams responsible for administering the grants to achieve that access. On the other side of the equation, the end user who needs access to a data asset may be left waiting for grants to be made as the decision is passed between teams. That is, if they even know the correct path to getting access in the first place.\n",
       "  \n",
       " Separating the concerns of managing data governance at a business level and implementing data governance at an engineering level is the best way to clarify data access permissions. In practice, this involves building systems to enable data governance enforcement based on business rules, with little to no understanding of the individual system where the data lives. \n",
       " \n",
       " In practice, with a concrete business rule, such as “only users from the finance team should have access to critical financial data,” we want a system that deals only with those constituent concepts. For example, “the data is marked as critical financial” and “the user is a part of the finance team”). By abstracting away any source system components, such as “the tables in the finance schema” and “someone who’s a member of the finance databricks group,” the access policies applied will then model the business rules as closely as possible.\n",
       " \n",
       " This talk will focus on how to establish and align the processes, policies, and stakeholders involved in making this type of system work seamlessly. Sharing the experience and learnings of our team at Instacart, we will aim to help attendees streamline and simplify their data security and access strategies.</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Managing Data Encryption in Apache Spark™</td><td>Sensitive data sets can be encrypted directly by new Apache Spark™  versions (3.2 and higher). Setting a number of configuration parameters and dataframe options will trigger the Apache Parquet modular encryption mechanism that protects select columns with column-specific keys. The upcoming Spark 3.4 version will also support uniform encryption, where all dataframe columns are encrypted with the same key.\n",
       " \n",
       " Spark data encryption is already leveraged by a number of companies to protect personal or business confidential data in their production environments. The main integration effort is focused on key access control and on building a Spark/Parquet plug-in code that can interact with company’s key management service (KMS).\n",
       " \n",
       " In this talk, we will briefly cover the basics of Spark/Parquet encryption usage, and dive into the details of encryption key management that will help in integrating this Spark data protection mechanism in your deployment. You will learn how to run a HelloWorld encryption sample, and how to extend it into a real world production code integrated with your organization’s KMS and access control policies. We will talk about the standard envelope encryption approach to big data protection, the performance-vs-security trade-offs between single and double envelope wrapping, internal and external key metadata storage. We will see a demo, and discuss the new features such as uniform encryption and two-tier management of encryption keys.</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Enabling Data Governance at Enterprise Scale Using Unity Catalog</td><td>For some time, Amgen has been building multiple enterprise platforms on the latest technology with a key focus on tech rationalization, data democratization, overall user experience, increase reusability and cost-effectiveness. One of these platforms is the enterprise data fabric platform. This platform specifically focuses on pulling in data across functions into a single platform building capabilities around the connectedness of data, and access governance.\n",
       " For a while, we have been trying to setup robust data governance capabilities which are simple, yet easy to manage through Databricks. As part of this process we evaluated products like privacera, Immuta, and Okera. While these tools could solve a few immediate needs like managing tables and database level, for the use cases like maintaining governance on highly restricted data domains like EDW(Finance) and Workday(HR), we felt that for the long term we will require a more Databricks native solution because of below reasons:\n",
       " - There were ways to bypass these tools on databricks cluster\n",
       " - Unsupported DBR runtime\n",
       " - Complexity of fine-grained security\n",
       " - Policy management – AWS IAM + Intool policies\n",
       "  To address these challenges, and for large-scale enterprise adoption of our governance capability, we started working on UC integration with our governance processes. Following tech benefits we realized:\n",
       " - Independent of Databricks runtime\n",
       " - Easy fine-grained access control\n",
       " - Eliminated management of IAM roles\n",
       " - Dynamic access control using UC and dynamic views\n",
       " As a result of these technical benefits, we were able to implement fine-grained and complex governance policies around the restricted data set of Amgen including Finance and Workday. At this point we have around 100K objects mapped in the Unity Catalog and growing rapidly.</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Lineage System Table in Unity Catalog</td><td>Unity Catalog provides fully automated data lineage for all workloads in SQL, R, Python, Scala and across all asset types at Databricks. The aggregated view has been available to end users through data explorer and API. In this session, we are excited to share that lineage is available via delta table in their UC metastore. It stores full history of recent lineage records and it is near real time. Additionally, customers can query it through standard SQL interface. With that, customers can get significant operational insights about their workload for impact analysis, troubleshooting, quality assurance, data discovery, and data governance. Together with the system table platform effort, which provides query history, job run operational data, audit logs and more, lineage table will be a critical piece to link all the data asset and entity asset together. It will provide better Lakehouse observability and unification to customers.</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Combining Privacy Solutions to Solve Data Access at Scale</td><td>The trend that has made data easier to collect and analyze, has only aggravated privacy risks. Luckily, a range of privacy technologies have emerged to enable private data management (differential privacy, synthetic data, confidential computing).  In isolation, those technologies have had a limited impact because they did not always bring the 10x improvement expected by data leaders.\n",
       " \n",
       " Combining these privacy technologies has been the real game changer. We will demonstrate that the right mix of technologies brings the optimal balance of privacy and flexibility at the scale of the data warehouse.  We will illustrate this by real-life applications of Sarus in three domains:\n",
       "Healthcare: how to make hospital data available for research at scale in full compliance\n",
       "Finance: how to pool data between several banks to fight criminal transactions\n",
       "Marketing: how to build insights on combined data from partners and distributors\n",
       " \n",
       " The examples will be illustrated using data stored in Databricks and queried using Sarus differential privacy engine.</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Map Your Lakehouse Content with DiscoverX</td><td>An enterprise lakehouse contains many different datasets which are related to different sources and might belong to different business units. \n",
       " These datasets can span across hundreds of tables, and each table has a different schema, and those schemas evolve over time. The Cyber security domain is a good example where datasets come from many different source systems and land in the lakehouse.\n",
       " With such a complex dataset ecosystem, answers to simple questions like “Have we ever detected this IP address?” or “Which columns contain IP addresses?” can become impractical and expensive.\n",
       " DiscoverX can automate the discovery of all columns that might contain specific patterns, (e.g. IP addresses, MAC addresses, fully qualified domain names, etc.) and automatically generate search and indexing queries that span across multiple tables and columns.</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Post-Merger: Implementing Unity Catalog Across Multiple Accounts</td><td>Warner Media and Discovery have recently merged to form Warner Bros Discovery.

The sheer number of enterprise cybersecurity toolsets, each capturing and generating its own data, creates significant data management and data engineering challenges for all enterprises. Because each of these security tools has separate logs, outputs, and databases, it prevents any security team from meaningfully understanding their overall security posture and using their own data effectively. We believe that cybersecurity is fundamentally a data management problem. In this presentation, we will show how treating cybersecurity as a data management problem, and subsequently opening disparate cybersecurity data to queries can help organizations secure their systems and data more effectively. In this presentation, practitioners will walk away understanding the value of modeled and organized security on a data warehouse. We will leverage a real-world use case that shows how Databricks can help solve vulnerability management and end-to-end workflows for security practitioners.</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Lakehouse Architecture to Advance Security Analytics at the Department of State</td><td>In 2023, the Department of State surged forward on implementing a Lakehouse architecture to get faster, smarter, and more effective on cybersecurity log monitoring and incident response.

It happened to be aggregations using DataFrame.groupBy operation with a custom Scala UDAF over a data stream from Kafka. Just a single simple-looking request that turned itself up into a a-few-month-long hunt to find a more performant query execution planning than ObjectHashAggregateExec that kept falling back to a sort-based aggregation (i.e. the worst possible aggregation runtime performance). It quickly taught us that an aggregation using a custom Scala UDAF cannot be planned other than ObjectHashAggregateExec but at least tasks don't always have to fall back. And that's just batch workloads. When you throw in streaming semantics and think of the different output modes, windowing and streaming watermark optimizing aggregation can take a long time to do right.\n",

However, many such turn-key solutions face challenges: cost-inefficient EDW targets; inability to evolve schema; forbiddingly expensive data exports due to cloud and vendor lock-in. The alternative: an open data lake that unifies batch and streaming workloads. Increasingly, we must adapt to a multi-cloud reality. Delta Lake decouples data storage from proprietary formats, dramatically reducing data extraction costs. Exporting data from delta tables eliminates the compute and storage API costs required by EDW. Bronze landing zones in Delta format build the foundation for a medallion architecture. Apache Spark™ Structured Streaming provides a unified ingestion strategy. Streaming triggers allow us to switch back and forth between batch and stream with one-line code changes. Streaming aggregation enables us to incrementally compute on data that arrives near each other.\n",
       " It is a misconception that streaming requires always-on clusters and thus is prohibitively expensive. Streaming means the ability to automatically handle new data and avoid reprocessing of historical data; real time is optional depending on use cases. Autoloader is a technique to discover newly arrived data and ensure exactly once, incremental processing. DLT further simplifies streaming jobs, accelerating the development cycle.\n",
       " Workflows bring it all together and the open source dbx project applies SWE best practices. Workflows can orchestrate tasks such as DLT pipelines, spark jobs, SQL scripts, as well as dbt transformations. Developers can define compute resources, scheduling, and dependencies in descriptive yaml format. Both task definitions and job code are versioned with popular source control systems.</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>Getting Insight From Anything: Gathering Data With IoT Devices and Delta Live</td><td>The drive to make data-driven decisions shapes the strategy of many companies. However, this dream has a problem; just because you need to make a decision does not mean you have the data to make it! Often these decisions require data from sources typically unconnected to the internet. This could be an architect determined to understand how the construction of her building is progressing, or a manufacturer wanting to live their best Industry 4.0 life. It's not uncommon for companies to find this journey to become “smart” is a long one; with difficult ethical ground to cover, or prohibitive costs associated with procuring the necessary equipment.

Few of these applications are driving critical business use cases like financial fraud detection, loan application processing, personalized offers, etc. These business critical applications need robust disaster recovery strategies to recover from the catastrophic events to reduce the lost uptime. However, most organizations find it hard to set up disaster recovery for streaming applications as it involves continuous data flow. Streaming state and temporal behavior of data brings additional complexities to the DR strategy.\n",
       " \n",
       " A reliable disaster recovery strategy includes backup, failover and failback approaches for the streaming application. Unlike the batch applications, these steps include many moving elements and need a very sophisticated approach to ensure that the services are failing over the DR region and meet the set RTO and RPO requirements.

Though we have up-to-date data in OLTP databases, they cannot support those scenarios. Data need to be replicated to a data warehouse to serve queries doing group-bys, and joins across tables from different systems. At Coinbase, we designed SOON (Spark cOntinuOus iNgestion) based on Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Spark as an incremental table replication solution to replicate tables of any size from any database to Delta Lake in a timely manner. It also supports Kafka events ingestion naturally.\n",

       " SOON incrementally ingests Kafka events as appends, updates, and deletes to an existing table on Delta Lake. The events are grouped into two categories: CDC (change data capture) events generated by Kafka Connect source connectors, and non-CDC events by the frontend or backend services. Both types can be appended or merged into the Delta Lake. Non-CDC events can be in any format, but CDC events must be in the standard SOON CDC schema. We implemented Kafka Connect SMTs to transform raw CDC events into this standardized format. SOON unifies all streaming ingestion scenarios such that users only need to learn one onboarding experience and the team only needs to maintain one framework.\n",

This is so we can target health and comfort conditions more suitably to areas where are more densely populated. Many of these buildings have Cisco IT infrastructure in them. Using their WIFI points and the RSSI signal strength from people’s laptops and phones, Cisco can calculate the number of people in each area of the building. Cisco Spaces offer this data up as a real-time streaming source. Honeywell HBT has utilised this stream of data by writing delta live table pipelines to consume this data source.\n",
       " Honeywell buildings can now receive this firehose data from hundred of concurrent customers and provide this occupancy data as a service to our vertical offerings in commercial, health, real estate and education. We will discuss the benefits of using DLT to handle this sort of incoming stream data, and illustrate the pain points we had and the resolutions we undertook in successfully receiving the stream of Cisco data. We will illustrate how our DLT pipeline was designed, and how it scaled to deal with huge quantities of real time streaming data.</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>Leveraging IoT Data at Scale to Mitigate Global Water Risks Using Apache Spark Streaming and Delta</td><td>Every year, billions of dollars are lost due to water risks from storms, floods, and droughts.

The client had a previous bad experience with another vendor, who overpromised and underdelivered on the latency of the streaming solution. The previous vendor delivered an over-complex streaming data pipeline resulting in the data taking over 5 minutes to reach a visualization layer. The client felt that architecture was too complex and involved many services integrated together. Our immediate challenges involved gaining the client's trust and proving that our design and implementation quality would supercede a previous experience. To resolve an immediate challenge of the overly complicated pipeline design, we deployed a Databricks Lakehouse architecture with Azure Databricks at the center of the solution. Our reference archiitecture integrated Genesys Cloud -> App Services -> Event Hub -> Databricks <-> Data Lake -> Power BI. The streaming solution proved to be low latency (seconds) during the POV stage, which led to subsequent productionalization of the pipeline with deployment of jobs, DLTs pipeline, including multi-notebook workflow and business and performance metrics dashboarding relied on by the call center staff for a day-to-day performance monitoring and improvements.</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Top Mistakes to Avoid in Streaming Applications</td><td>Nowadays, streaming use cases become very important in almost all companies. When you think of streaming, Apache Spark™ Structured Streaming is at the top of the list in the technology. As we are dealing with many customer streaming use cases, we learned many do’s and don’t of the streaming application. I will be discussing the top mistakes to avoid when working with streaming applications with regard to different sources and sinks like DLT, Kafka, Delta, and so on. If you are avoiding these mistakes while architecting/running/restarting the application, then you will avoid the costly mistakes at a later point in time.</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td>Embracing the Future of Data Engineering: The Serverless, Real-Time Lakehouse in Action</td><td>As we venture into the future of data engineering, streaming and serverless technologies take center stage.

The main reason is that DS V1 uses column stats, especially number of distinct values (NDV) for query optimization. Currently, Spark DS V2 only has interfaces for data sources to report table statistics such as size in bytes and number of rows. In order to use column stats in DS V2, we have added new interfaces to allow external data sources to report column stats to Spark. For a data source with huge data, it’s always challenging to get the column stats, especially the NDV. We plan to calculate NDV using Apache DataSketches Theta sketch and save the serialized compact sketch in the statistics file. The NDV and other column stats will be reported to Spark for query plan optimization.</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>Databricks Powered Enterprise Data Platform for Faster Insights with Optimal Cost</td><td>A leading Australian Bank engaged Deloitte to review architecture of current enterprise data platform enabled using Databricks.

By the multi-fold performance improvement from these solutions, more and more Spark users have started to adopt the new technology. One characteristics of native libraries is that they all use columnar data format as the basic data format. It's because the columnar data format has the intrinsic affinity to vectorized data processing using SIMD instructions. While vanilla Spark's shuffle is based on spark's internal row data format. The high overhead of the columnar to row and row to columnar conversion during the shuffle makes reusing current shuffle not possible. Due to the importance of shuffle service in Spark, we have to implement an efficient columnar shuffle, which brings couple of new challenges, like the split of columnar data, or the dictionary support during shuffle.\n",
       " \n",
       " In this session, we will share 1) the exploration process of the columnar shuffle design during our Gazelle and Gluten development, and best practices for implementing the columnar shuffle service. We will also share how we learned from the development of vanilla Spark's shuffle, for example, how to address the small files issue then we will propose the new shuffle solution. We will show the performance comparison between Columnar shuffle and vanilla Spark's row-based shuffle. Finally, we will share how the new built-in accelerators like QAT and IAA in the latest Intel processor are used in our columnar shuffle service and boost the performance.</td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td>What Happens When Curious and Knowledgeable Business People are Provided Access to the Right Data and Equipped With Simple Tools and Supported by Guidance From In-House Technical Experts</td><td>Too often business decisions in large organizations are based on time consuming and labor-intensive data extracts, fragile excel or access sheets that require significant manual intervention.

They started using Databricks as a simple solution to centralizing our development on the cloud. This helped lessen the issue of siloed development in our team, and allowed us to leverage the benefits of distributed cloud computing. But we quickly found that Databricks was a perfect solution to another problem that we faced in our data engineering stack. Specifically, cost, complexity, and scalability issues hampered our data architecture development for years, and we decided we needed to modernize our stack by migrating to a lakehouse. With our lakehouse, ad-hoc-analytics, ETL operations, and MLOps all living within Databricks, development at scale has never been easier for our team. Going forward, we hope to fully eliminate the silos of development, and remove the disconnect between our analytics and data engineering teams. From computer vision, pose analytics, and player tracking, to pitch design, base stealing likelihood, and more, come see how the Texas Rangers are using innovative cloud technologies to create action-driven reports from the current sea of Big Data. </td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>Improving Hospital Operations With Streaming Data and Real Time AI/ML</td><td>Over the past two years, Providence has developed a robust streaming data platform (SDP) leveraging Databricks in Azure. The SDP enables us to ingest and process real-time data reflecting clinical operations across our 52 hospitals and roughly 1000 ambulatory clinics. HL7 messages generated by Epic are parsed using Databricks in our secure cloud environment and used to generate an up-to-the minute picture of exactly what is happening at the point of care. We are already leveraging this information to minimize hospital overcrowding and have been actively integrating AI/ML to accurately forecast future conditions (e.g., arrivals, length of stay, acuity, and discharge requirements). This allows us to both improve resource utilization (e.g., nurse staffing levels) and to optimize patient throughput. The result is both improved patient care and operational efficiency. In this session we will share how these outcomes are only possible with the power and elegance afforded by our investments in Azure, Databricks, and increasingly Lakehouse. We will demonstrate Providence's blueprint for enabling real-time analytics which can be generalized to other healthcare providers.</td><td>141</td></tr><tr><td>AI Regulation is Coming: The EU AI Act and How Databricks Can Help with Compliance</td><td>With the heightened attention on LLMs and what they can do, and the widening impact of AI on day-to-day life, the push by regulators across the globe to regulate AI is intensifying.

For example, common models can be used for classification of images, sentiment analysis of text, language translation, anomaly detection, and many other use cases. Applying these models within Spark can be done today with the combination of PySpark, PandasUDF, and a lot of glue code. Often, that glue code can be difficult to get right, because it requires expertise across multiple domains - DL frameworks, PySpark APIs, PandasUDF internal behavior, and performance optimization.\n",

Should the model be univariate or multivariate? What features warrant the best model inputs? What model type should you choose? Are the best hyperparameters selected? All of these parts of the modeling process can be quite costly in terms of both time and computational resources. In this session, you will see solution we've created called DEIMOS (Deep Experimental Integrated Multivariate Optimized Series). DEIMOS is built to handle many of the critical problems in time-series modeling automatically and at scale. This package is designed to be simple and straightforward to use, with easily interpretable results to both technical and non-technical audiences.

While developing ML models is technically possible using either platform, the Hitachi Solutions Empower team tested which solution will be easier, faster, and cheaper to work with in terms of both user experience and business outcomes for our customers. To do this, we designed and conducted a series of experiments with use cases from the TPCx-AI benchmark standard. We developed both single-node and multi-node versions of these experiments, which sometimes required us to set up separate compute infrastructure outside of the platform, in the case of Snowflake. We also built datasets of various sizes (1GB, 10GB, and 100GB), to assess how each platform/node setup handles scale. Based on our findings. On the average, Databricks is faster, cheaper, and easier to use for developing machine learning models, and we use it exclusively for data science on the Empower platform. Snowflake’s reliance on third party resources for distributed training is a major drawback, and the need to use multiple compute environments to scale up training is complex and, in our view, an unnecessary complication to achieve best results.</td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>Testing Generative AI Models - What You Need to Know</td><td>Generative AI shows incredible promise for enterprise applications. The explosion of generative AI can be attributed to the convergence of several factors.

However, they typically do not decouple compute and storage, making them hard to integrate in production data stacks. Because data storage in these databases is expensive and not easily accessible, data teams typically maintain ETL pipelines to offload historical embedding data to blob stores. When that data needs to be queried, they get loaded back into the vector database in another ETL process. This is reminiscent of loading data from OLTP database to cloud storage, then loading said data into an OLAP warehouse for offline analytics. Recently, “lakehouse” offerings allow direct OLAP querying on cloud storage, removing the need for the second ETL step. The same could be done for embedding data. While embedding storage in blob stores cannot satisfy the high TPS requirements in online settings, we argue it’s sufficient for offline analytics use cases like slicing and dicing data based on embedding clusters. Instead of loading the embedding data back into the vector database for offline analytics, we propose direct processing on embeddings stored in Parquet files in Delta Lake. You will see that offline embedding workloads typically touch a large portion of the stored embeddings without the need for random access. As a result, the workload is entirely bound by network throughput instead of latency, making it quite suitable for blob storage backends. On a test 1 billion vector dataset, ETL into cloud storage takes around 1 hour on a dedicated GPU instance, while batched nearest neighbor search can be done in under one minute with four CPU instances. We believe future “lakehouses” will ship with native support for these embedding workloads.</td><td>169</td></tr><tr><td>JoinBoost: In-DB ML for Tree-Models</td><td>Data and Machine Learning (ML) are crucial for enterprise operations. Enterprises store data in databases for management and use ML to gain business insights. However, there is a mismatch between the way ML expects data to be organized (a single table) and the way data is organized in databases (a join graph of multiple tables) and leads to inefficiencies when joining and materializing tables. In this session, you will see how we successfully address this issue. We introduce JoinBoost, a lightweight python library that trains tree models (such as random forests and gradient boosting) for join graphs in databases. JoinBoost acts as a query rewriting layer that is compatible with cloud databases, and eliminates the need for costly join materialization.</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>Demonstrate-Search-Predict: Composing Retrieval and Language Models for Knowledge-Intensive NLP</td><td>In this session, you will learn about how retrieval-augmented in-context learning has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing knowledge-intensive tasks using frozen language models (LM) and retrieval models (RM). Existing work has combined these in simple “retrieve-then-read” pipelines in which the RM retrieves passages that are inserted into the LM prompt. To begin to fully realize the potential of frozen LMs and RMs, we propose Demonstrate–Search–Predict (DSP), a framework that relies on passing natural language texts in sophisticated pipelines between an LM and an RM. DSP can express high-level programs that bootstrap pipeline-aware demonstrations, search for relevant passages, and generate grounded predictions, systematically breaking down problems into small transformations that the LM and RM can handle more reliably. We have written novel DSP programs for answering questions in open-domain, multi-hop, and conversational settings, establishing in early evaluations new state-of-the-art in-context learning results and delivering 37–125%, 8–40%, and 80–290% relative gains against vanilla LMs, a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline, and a contemporaneous self-ask pipeline, respectively.</td><td>171</td></tr><tr><td>Data Caching Strategies for Data Analytics and AI</td><td>The increasing popularity of data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a dramatic increase in the volume of data being used in these fields, creating a growing need for an enhanced computational capability. Cache plays a crucial role as an accelerator for data and AI computations, but it is important to note that these domains have different data access patterns, requiring different cache strategies. In this session, you will see our observations on data access patterns in the analytical SQL and AI training domains based on practical experience with large-scale systems. We will discuss the evaluation results of various caching strategies for analytical SQL and AI and provide caching recommendations for different use cases. Over the years, we have learned some best practices from big internet companies about the following aspects of our journey: 1. Traffic pattern for analytical SQL and cache strategy recommendation, 2. Traffic pattern for AI training and how we can measure the cache efficiency for different AI training process, 3. Cache capacity planning based on real-time metrics of the working set, and 4.

         "Instacart has gone through immense growth during the pandemic and the trend continues. Instacart ads is no exception in this growth story. We have launched many new product lines including display and video ads covering the full advertising funnel to address the increasing demand of our retail partners. We have built advanced models to auto-suggest optimal bidding to increase the ROI for our CPG partners. Advertisers’ trust is the utmost priority and thus the quest to build a top-class ads measurement platform.\n \n Ads data processing requires complex data verifications to update ads serving stats. In ETL pipelines these were implemented through files containing thousands of lines of raw SQL which were hard to scale, test, and iterate upon. Our data engineers used to spend hours testing small changes due to a lack of local testing mechanisms. \n \n These pain points stress our need for better tools. After some research, we chose Apache Spark™ as our preferred tool to rebuild ETLs, and the Databricks platform made this move easier. In this presentation, I will share our journey to move our pipelines to Spark and Delta Lake on Databricks. With spark, scala, and delta we solved many problems which were slowing the team’s productivity. Some key areas I will cover include:\n - Modular and composable code\n - Unit testing framework\n - Incremental event processing with spark structured streaming \n - Granular resource tuning for better performance and cost efficacy\n \n Other than the domain business logic, the problems discussed here are quite common for performing data processing at scale. I would be glad to have the opportunity to share our learning and am hopeful that it will benefit others who are going through similar growth challenges or migrating to Lakehouse.",

I’ll discuss the differences between the ABAC and legacy Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) approaches to control access and how the RBAC approach is not sufficient to keep up with today’s growing big data market. With so much data available, there also comes substantial risk. Data can contain many sensitive data elements, including PII and PHI. Industry leaders like Databricks are pushing the boundaries of data technology, which leads to constantly evolving data use cases. And that’s a good thing! However, the RBAC approach is struggling to keep up with those advancements.\n So what is RBAC? It’s an approach to data access that permits system access based on the end-user’s role. For legacy systems, it’s meant as a simple but effective approach to securing data. Are you a manager? Then you’ll get access to data meant for managers. This is great for small deployments with clearly defined roles. Here at Booz Allen, we invested in Databricks because we have an environment of over 30k users and billions of rows of data.\n To mitigate this problem and align with our forward-thinking company standard, we introduced Immuta into our stack. Immuta uses ABAC to allow for dynamic data access control. Users are automatically assigned certain attributes, and access is based on those attributes instead of just their role. This allows for more flexibility and allows data access control to easily scale without the need to constantly map a user to their role. Using attributes, we can write policies in one place and have them applied across all of our data platforms.

         "This session focuses on one of the first Unity Catalog implementations for a large-scale enterprise. In this scenario, a cloud scale analytics platform with 7500 active users based on the lakehouse approach is used. In addition, there is potential for 1500 further users who are subject to special governance rules. They are consuming 600+TB of data stored in Delta Lake - continuously growing at more than 1TB per day. This might grow due to local country data.\n Therefore, the existing data platform must be extended to enable users to combine global and local data from their countries. A new data management was required, which reflects the strict information security rules at a need to know base. Core requirements are: read only from global data, write into local and share the results.\n Due to a very pronounced information security awareness and a lack of the technological possibilities it was not possible to interdisciplinary analyze and exchange data so easy or at all so far. Therefore, a lot of business potential and gains could not be identified and realized.\n With the new developments in the technology used and the basis of the Lakehouse approach, thanks to Unity Catalog, we were able to develop a solution that could meet high requirements for security and process. And enables globally secured interdisciplinary data exchange and analysis at scale.\n This solution enables the democratization of the data. This results not only in the ability to gain better insights for business management, but also to generate entirely new business cases or products that require a higher degree of data integration and encourage the culture to change.\n We highlight technical challenges and solutions, present best practices and point out benefits of implementing Unity catalog for enterprises.",

Privacy violation fines are reaching record highs and will only get higher as governments continue to crack down on the runaway abuse of user data. To continue producing value without becoming a liability, data systems must include privacy protections at a foundational level.\n \n The most practical way to do this is to enable privacy as code, shifting privacy left and including it as a foundational part of the organization's software development life cycle. The promise of privacy as code is that data organizations can be liberated from inefficient, manual workflows for producing the compliance deliverables their legal teams need, and instead ship at speed with pre-defined privacy guardrails built into the structure of their preferred workflows.\n \n Despite being an emerging and complex problem, there are already powerful open source tools available designed to help organizations of all sizes achieve this outcome. Fides is an open source privacy as code tool, written in Python and Typescript, that is engineered to tackle a variety of privacy problems throughout the application lifecycle. The most relevant feature for data organizations is the ability to annotate systems and their datasets with data privacy metadata, thus enabling automatic rejection of dangerous or illegal uses.

The teams responsible for creating the business rules that govern who should have access to what data are usually different from the teams responsible for administering the grants to achieve that access. On the other side of the equation, the end user who needs access to a data asset may be left waiting for grants to be made as the decision is passed between teams. That is, if they even know the correct path to getting access in the first place.\n  \n Separating the concerns of managing data governance at a business level and implementing data governance at an engineering level is the best way to clarify data access permissions. In practice, this involves building systems to enable data governance enforcement based on business rules, with little to no understanding of the individual system where the data lives. \n \n In practice, with a concrete business rule, such as “only users from the finance team should have access to critical financial data,” we want a system that deals only with those constituent concepts. For example, “the data is marked as critical financial” and “the user is a part of the finance team”). By abstracting away any source system components, such as “the tables in the finance schema” and “someone who’s a member of the finance databricks group,” the access policies applied will then model the business rules as closely as possible.\n \n This talk will focus on how to establish and align the processes, policies, and stakeholders involved in making this type of system work seamlessly.

         "For most of my professional life, I've dealt with data. As a data practitioner, I developed algorithms to solve real-world problems leveraging machine learning techniques. As an engineer, I led the direction that brought the value of my hands-on machine learning experience into our products and services by building upon cutting-edge and emerging technologies. This experience has taught me that scaling data systems is harder than you might think. \n  \n Supporting the operations of scalable data environments poses a challenge greater than the known application-level support due to the complexity of managing data together with the application. Why is data adding so much complexity? Well, data is big, so all systems are now becoming distributed. Data changes and evolves, and it's hard to create repeatable, automated pipelines. Plus, technology is advancing at an alarming rate and changes are messy.\n  \n Interested in learning about all the most recent updates in the data space? How does that impact our data systems? In this talk, you will learn about the challenges of product quality, delivery velocity, production monitoring, and outage recovery, see how those can be met using best practices in the tech stack, and develop empathy for those who manage scalable data environments.",

These problems led to mistrust in data sets and made it difficult to scale to meet the strategic globalization plan we had for Conde Nast.\n \n Over the last few years we have been extremely successful in building a centralized data platform on Databricks in AWS, fully embracing the lakehouse vision from end-to-end. Now, our analysts and marketers can derive the same insights from one dataset and data scientists can use the same datasets for use cases such as personalization, subscriber propensity models, churn models and on-site recommendations for our iconic brands.\n \n In this talk, we’ll discuss how we plan to incorporate Unity Catalog and Delta Sharing as the next phase of our globalization mission. The evergreen platform has become the global standard for data processing and analytics at Conde. In order to manage the worldwide data and comply with GDPR requirements, we need to make sure data is processed in the appropriate region and PII data is handled appropriately. At the same time, we need to have a global view of the data to allow us to make business decisions at the global level. We’ll talk about how delta sharing allows us a simple, secure way to share de-identified datasets across regions in order to make these strategic business decisions, while complying with security requirements. Additionally, we’ll discuss how Unity Catalog allows us to secure, govern and audit these datasets in an easy and scalable manner.",

         "The emergence of secure data sharing is already having a tremendous economic impact, in large part due to the increasing ease and safety of sharing financial data. McKinsey predicts that the impact of open financial data will be 1-4.5% of GDP globally by 2030. This indicates there is a narrowing window on a massive opportunity for financial institutions and it is critical that they prioritize data sharing. This session will first address the ways in which Delta Sharing and Unity Catalog on a Databricks Lakehouse architecture provides a simple and open framework for building a Secure Data Sharing platform in the financial services industry. Next we will use a Databricks environment to walk through different use cases for open banking data and secure data sharing, demonstrating how they will be implemented using Delta Sharing, Unity Catalog, and other parts of the Lakehouse platform. The use cases will include examples of new product features such as Databricks to Databricks sharing, change data feed and streaming on Delta Sharing, table/column lineage, and the Delta Sharing Excel plugin to demonstrate state of the art sharing capabilities.\n Spencer Cook, a Sr. Solutions Architect at Databricks focussed on the Financial Services industry will discuss secure data sharing on Databricks Lakehouse and will demonstrate architecture and code for common sharing use cases in the finance industry.",

However, IoT predictive maintenance is challenged by the lack of effective, scalable infrastructure and machine learning solutions. IoT data can be the size of multiple terabytes per day and can come in a variety of formats. Furthermore, without any insights and analysis, this data becomes just another table. \n \n The KPMG Databricks IoT Accelerator is an end-to-end solution enabling manufacturing plant operators to have a bird’s eye view of their machines’ health and empowers proactive machine maintenance across their portfolio of IoT devices. The Databricks Accelerator ingests IoT streaming data at scale and implements the Databricks medallion architecture while leveraging delta live tables to clean and process data. Real time machine learning models are developed from IoT machine measurements and are managed in MLflow. The AI predictions and IoT device readings are compiled in the gold table powering downstream dashboards like Tableau. Dashboards inform machine operators of not only machines’ ailments, but action they can take to mitigate issues before they arise. Operators can see fault history to aid in understanding failure trends, and can filter dashboards by fault type, machine, or specific sensor reading.",

         "I've got a client recently who asked me to optimize their batch and streaming workloads. It happened to be aggregations using DataFrame.groupBy operation with a custom Scala UDAF over a data stream from Kafka. Just a single simple-looking request that turned itself up into a a-few-month-long hunt to find a more performant query execution planning than ObjectHashAggregateExec that kept falling back to a sort-based aggregation (i.e. the worst possible aggregation runtime performance). It quickly taught us that an aggregation using a custom Scala UDAF cannot be planned other than ObjectHashAggregateExec but at least tasks don't always have to fall back. And that's just batch workloads. When you throw in streaming semantics and think of the different output modes, windowing and streaming watermark optimizing aggregation can take a long time to do right.\n \n During the talk you'll learn the different execution strategies of aggregation (groupBy) in Apache Spark and what issues I faced while hunting down the tiniest performance improvements. You will learn why an aggregation with a Scala UDAF cannot be planned using HashAggregateExec and what problems you may come across while using streaming aggregation over the built-in Kafka data source.

         "An assortment of low-code connectors boasts the ability to make data available for analytics in real time. However, many such turn-key solutions face challenges: cost-inefficient EDW targets; inability to evolve schema; forbiddingly expensive data exports due to cloud and vendor lock-in. The alternative: an open data lake that unifies batch and streaming workloads. Increasingly, we must adapt to a multi-cloud reality. Delta Lake decouples data storage from proprietary formats, dramatically reducing data extraction costs. Exporting data from delta tables eliminates the compute and storage API costs required by EDW. Bronze landing zones in Delta format build the foundation for a medallion architecture. Apache Spark™ Structured Streaming provides a unified ingestion strategy. Streaming triggers allow us to switch back and forth between batch and stream with one-line code changes. Streaming aggregation enables us to incrementally compute on data that arrives near each other.\n It is a misconception that streaming requires always-on clusters and thus is prohibitively expensive. Streaming means the ability to automatically handle new data and avoid reprocessing of historical data; real time is optional depending on use cases. Autoloader is a technique to discover newly arrived data and ensure exactly once, incremental processing. DLT further simplifies streaming jobs, accelerating the development cycle.\n Workflows bring it all together and the open source dbx project applies SWE best practices. Workflows can orchestrate tasks such as DLT pipelines, spark jobs, SQL scripts, as well as dbt transformations. Developers can define compute resources, scheduling, and dependencies in descriptive yaml format. Both task definitions and job code are versioned with popular source control systems.",

Few of these applications are driving critical business use cases like financial fraud detection, loan application processing, personalized offers, etc. These business critical applications need robust disaster recovery strategies to recover from the catastrophic events to reduce the lost uptime. However, most organizations find it hard to set up disaster recovery for streaming applications as it involves continuous data flow. Streaming state and temporal behavior of data brings additional complexities to the DR strategy.\n \n A reliable disaster recovery strategy includes backup, failover and failback approaches for the streaming application. Unlike the batch applications, these steps include many moving elements and need a very sophisticated approach to ensure that the services are failing over the DR region and meet the set RTO and RPO requirements. In this session, we will cover following topics with a FINSERV use case demo:\n 1. Backup strategy: backup of delta tables, message bus services and checkpoint including offsets\n 2.

This data is analyzed by various ML algorithms to detect any suspicious activity. The ML models need correlated data in real-time so vulnerabilities can be detected instantly and remediation actions can be taken.\n \n The data pipeline comprises of multiple event sources, each one of them producing high volumes of continuous data. This data generated from different sources need to be correlated using common identifiers to produce final stream of data with low latency and high data quality.\n \n The proposed solution is to build scalable, extensible, fault-tolerant system for stateful joining of two or more high volume event streams that are not fully synchronised, event ordering is not guaranteed, and certain events arrive a bit late. The system also ensures to combine the events/link so the data is in near real-time with low latency so that there is no impact on the downstream applications like ML models in determining the suspicious behavior.

Data need to be replicated to a data warehouse to serve queries doing group-bys, and joins across tables from different systems. At Coinbase, we designed SOON (Spark cOntinuOus iNgestion) based on Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Spark as an incremental table replication solution to replicate tables of any size from any database to Delta Lake in a timely manner. It also supports Kafka events ingestion naturally.\n \n SOON incrementally ingests Kafka events as appends, updates, and deletes to an existing table on Delta Lake. The events are grouped into two categories: CDC (change data capture) events generated by Kafka Connect source connectors, and non-CDC events by the frontend or backend services. Both types can be appended or merged into the Delta Lake. Non-CDC events can be in any format, but CDC events must be in the standard SOON CDC schema. We implemented Kafka Connect SMTs to transform raw CDC events into this standardized format. SOON unifies all streaming ingestion scenarios such that users only need to learn one onboarding experience and the team only needs to maintain one framework.\n \n We care about the ingestion performance. The biggest append-only table onboarded has ingress traffic at hundreds of thousands events per second; the biggest CDC-merge table onboarded has a snapshot size of a few TBs and CDC update traffic at hundreds of events per second. A lot of innovative ideas are incorporated in SOON to improve its performance, such as min-max range merge optimization, KMeans merge optimization, no-update merge for deduplication, generated columns as partitions, etc.",

         "When doing the TPC-DS benchmark using external V2 data source, we have observed that for several of the queries, DS V1 has better join plans than Spark. The main reason is that DS V1 uses column stats, especially number of distinct values (NDV) for query optimization. Currently, Spark DS V2 only has interfaces for data sources to report table statistics such as size in bytes and number of rows. In order to use column stats in DS V2, we have added new interfaces to allow external data sources to report column stats to Spark. For a data source with huge data, it’s always challenging to get the column stats, especially the NDV. We plan to calculate NDV using Apache DataSketches Theta sketch and save the serialized compact sketch in the statistics file. The NDV and other column stats will be reported to Spark for query plan optimization.",

By the multi-fold performance improvement from these solutions, more and more Spark users have started to adopt the new technology. One characteristics of native libraries is that they all use columnar data format as the basic data format. It's because the columnar data format has the intrinsic affinity to vectorized data processing using SIMD instructions. While vanilla Spark's shuffle is based on spark's internal row data format. The high overhead of the columnar to row and row to columnar conversion during the shuffle makes reusing current shuffle not possible. Due to the importance of shuffle service in Spark, we have to implement an efficient columnar shuffle, which brings couple of new challenges, like the split of columnar data, or the dictionary support during shuffle.\n \n In this session, we will share 1) the exploration process of the columnar shuffle design during our Gazelle and Gluten development, and best practices for implementing the columnar shuffle service. We will also share how we learned from the development of vanilla Spark's shuffle, for example, how to address the small files issue then we will propose the new shuffle solution.

         "In the spring and summer of 2022, monkeypox was detected in the United States and quickly spread throughout the country. To contain and mitigate the spread of the disease in Washington State, the Washington Department of Health data science team used the Databricks platform to develop a modeling pipeline that employed statistical and mathematical techniques to forecast the course of the monkeypox outbreak throughout the state. These models provided actionable information that helped inform decision making and guide the public health response to the outbreak. \n \n We used contact-tracing data, standard line-lists, and published parameters to train a variety of time-series forecasting models, including an ARIMA model, a Poisson regression, and an SEIR compartmental model. We also calculated the daily R-effective rate as an additional output. The compartmental model best fit the reported cases when tested out of sample, but the statistical models were quicker and easier to deploy and helped inform initial decision-making. The R-effective rate was particularly useful throughout the effort. \n \n Overall, these efforts highlighted the importance of rapidly deployable and scalable infectious disease modeling pipelines. Public health data science is still a nascent field, however, so common best practices in other industries are often-times novel approaches in public health. The need for stable, generalizable pipelines is crucial. Using the Databricks platform has allowed us to more quickly scale and iteratively improve our modeling pipelines to include other infectious diseases, such as influenza and RSV. Further development of scalable and standardized approaches to disease forecasting at the state and local level is vital to better informing future public health response efforts.",

         "In recent years, similar principles to those of DevOps in software development have been applied to Machine Learning projects with the goal of productionizing automated solutions. However, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices have proven to be of difficult implementation, as they often require putting together several different tools in a complex architecture. In this session, we introduce MLOps concepts and describe how we implement MLOps principles in our projects at Gucci by leveraging Databricks functionalities. A use case of deploying a data science tool for supporting media budget allocation decisions is presented. After the development of a POC to experiment and effectively address the business problem, the code was versioned and refactored. Code reviews were executed to ensure quality and readability. Within Databricks, we rapidly moved the project to the production stage by achieving an automated solution including unit tests, environment configuration, registration and versioning of models, monitoring of model performances as well as model serving and a dashboard to visualize results. This template is being successfully replicated for other projects and is allowing our new Data Science team to quickly bring value to different business areas of the company. These best practices and insights can be used as an example of how this can be beneficial to you or other practitioners.",

         "At Ahold Delhaize, we have 19 local brands. Most of our brands have common goals, such as providing personalized offers to their customers, a better search engine on e-commerce websites, and forecasting models to reduce food waste and ensure availability. As a central team, our goal is to standardize the way of working across all of these brands, including the deployment of machine learning models. To this end, we have adopted Databricks as our standard platform for our batch inference models. \n\nHowever, API deployment for real time inference models remained challenging due to the varying capabilities of our brands. Our attempts to standardize API deployments with different tools failed due to complexity of our organization. Fortunately, Databricks has recently introduced a new feature: serverless API deployment. Since all our brands already use Databricks, this feature was easy to adopt. It allows us to easily reuse API deployment across all of our brands, significantly reducing time to market (from 6-12 months to 1 month), increasing efficiency, and reducing the costs. In this session, you will see the solution architecture, sample use case specifically used to cross-sell model deployed to 4 different brands, and API deployment using Databricks Serverless API with custom model.",

         "Apache Spark is a popular distributed framework for big data processing. It is commonly used for ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) across large datasets. Today, the Transform stage can often include the application of Deep Learning models on the data. For example, common models can be used for classification of images, sentiment analysis of text, language translation, anomaly detection, and many other use cases. Applying these models within Spark can be done today with the combination of PySpark, PandasUDF, and a lot of glue code. Often, that glue code can be difficult to get right, because it requires expertise across multiple domains - DL frameworks, PySpark APIs, PandasUDF internal behavior, and performance optimization.\n \n In this talk, we introduce a new, simplified API for DL inferencing on Spark, introduced in SPARK-40264 as a collaboration between NVIDIA and Databricks, which seeks to standardize and open-source this glue code to make DL inference integrations easier for everyone. We discuss its design and demonstrate its usage across multiple DL frameworks and models.",

         "Snowflake and Databricks both aim to provide data science toolkits for machine learning workflows, albeit with different approaches and resources. While developing ML models is technically possible using either platform, the Hitachi Solutions Empower team tested which solution will be easier, faster, and cheaper to work with in terms of both user experience and business outcomes for our customers. To do this, we designed and conducted a series of experiments with use cases from the TPCx-AI benchmark standard. We developed both single-node and multi-node versions of these experiments, which sometimes required us to set up separate compute infrastructure outside of the platform, in the case of Snowflake. We also built datasets of various sizes (1GB, 10GB, and 100GB), to assess how each platform/node setup handles scale. Based on our findings. On the average, Databricks is faster, cheaper, and easier to use for developing machine learning models, and we use it exclusively for data science on the Empower platform. Snowflake’s reliance on third party resources for distributed training is a major drawback, and the need to use multiple compute environments to scale up training is complex and, in our view, an unnecessary complication to achieve best results.",

Most significant is that the barrier to entry has dropped for AI application developers through customizable prompts (few-shot learning), enabling laypeople to generate high-quality content. The flexibility of models like ChatGPT and DALLE-2 have sparked curiosity and creativity about new applications that they can support. The number of tools will continue to grow in a manner similar to how AWS fueled app development.\n \n But excitement must be tampered by concerns about new risks imposed to business and society. Increased capability and adoption also increase risk exposure. As organizations explore creative boundaries of generative models, measures to reduce risk must be put in place. However, the enormous size of the input space and inherent complexity make this task more challenging than traditional ML models.\n \n In this talk, we summarize the new risks introduced by the new class of generative foundation models through several examples, and compare how these risks relate to the risks of mainstream discriminative models. Steps can be taken to reduce the operational risk, bias and fairness issues, and privacy and security of systems that leverage LLM for automation. We’ll explore model hallucinations, output evaluation, output bias, prompt injection, data leakage, stochasticity, and more. We’ll discuss some of the larger issues common to LLMs and show how to test for them. A comprehensive, test-based approach to generative AI development will help instill model integrity by proactively mitigating failure and the associated business risk.",

Half of the content was not being properly analyzed and targeted intelligently. TTD attempted to build a model using Spark NLP, however the package could not scale and was not cost-effective. GPU utilization was low and the solution was cost prohibitive (over $400K/year). TTD engaged with Databricks in early 2022 to build an NLP model on Databricks. Our teams partnered closely together.  We were able to build a solution using distributed inference (150-200 GPUs running at 80%+ utilization);  Databricks could translate the 50 Million web pages each day for 35+ languages for $6K per month - 200x faster and at a fraction of the cost.

         "Vector databases such as ElasticSearch and Pinecone offer fast ingestion and querying on vector embeddings with ANNs. However, they typically do not decouple compute and storage, making them hard to integrate in production data stacks. Because data storage in these databases is expensive and not easily accessible, data teams typically maintain ETL pipelines to offload historical embedding data to blob stores. When that data needs to be queried, they get loaded back into the vector database in another ETL process. This is reminiscent of loading data from OLTP database to cloud storage, then loading said data into an OLAP warehouse for offline analytics. Recently, “lakehouse” offerings allow direct OLAP querying on cloud storage, removing the need for the second ETL step. The same could be done for embedding data. While embedding storage in blob stores cannot satisfy the high TPS requirements in online settings, we argue it’s sufficient for offline analytics use cases like slicing and dicing data based on embedding clusters. Instead of loading the embedding data back into the vector database for offline analytics, we propose direct processing on embeddings stored in Parquet files in Delta Lake. You will see that offline embedding workloads typically touch a large portion of the stored embeddings without the need for random access. As a result, the workload is entirely bound by network throughput instead of latency, making it quite suitable for blob storage backends. On a test 1 billion vector dataset, ETL into cloud storage takes around 1 hour on a dedicated GPU instance, while batched nearest neighbor search can be done in under one minute with four CPU instances. We believe future “lakehouses” will ship with native support for these embedding workloads.",

To begin to fully realize the potential of frozen LMs and RMs, we propose Demonstrate–Search–Predict (DSP), a framework that relies on passing natural language texts in sophisticated pipelines between an LM and an RM. DSP can express high-level programs that bootstrap pipeline-aware demonstrations, search for relevant passages, and generate grounded predictions, systematically breaking down problems into small transformations that the LM and RM can handle more reliably. We have written novel DSP programs for answering questions in open-domain, multi-hop, and conversational settings, establishing in early evaluations new state-of-the-art in-context learning results and delivering 37–125%, 8–40%, and 80–290% relative gains against vanilla LMs, a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline, and a contemporaneous self-ask pipeline, respectively.",

    "In this demo, we explored building a multi-stage reasoning system with Databricks' tools and LangChain. We began by introducing common system components and then focused on creating chains for specific tasks like answering user queries and finding DAIS-2023 talks. By the end, participants learned to use LangChain beyond just LLMs and construct sequential chains for multi-stage analyses."
